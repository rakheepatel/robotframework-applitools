# robotframework-applitools
This is a demo project to show how to use Applitools with Robot Framework.
The idea is to set up the application you are testing to a state where you want to take the screenshots to be compared.

For more information about Robot Framework, please see [robotframework.org](http://robotframework.org/).
For more information about Applitools, please see [applitools.com](https://applitools.com/)

## Installing Applitools library
Use pip to install the library required.

`pip install Robot-AppEyes`

For more information, please see [this page](https://github.com/NaviNet/Robot-AppEyes)

I have included the RobotAppEyes file in my Resources folder for reference, but you shouldn't need it. When you install the library using pip, a more up-to-date copy will be added automatically to your libraries section.
